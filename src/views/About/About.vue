      Our mission is to continue the work of Aaron Scwarts towards making

      Too long have journal giants put articles and research that were originally freely provided by academics behind a paywall restricting information access to those that cannot afford it.

      As it stands, regardless of whether you are a student at a university, an independent researcher or some curious human being, because of paywalls you can be hindered by being unable to access research that would further your knowledge. We think this is unacceptable.
