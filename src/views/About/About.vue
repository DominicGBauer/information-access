      Aaron Swartz was a computer programming prodigy and activist who played an
      instrumental role in the campaign for a free and open Internet. In 2000,
      Swartz co-authored RSS version 1.0 and thereafter joined a working group
      at the World Wide Web Consortium to develop common data formats used on
      the World Wide Web- he was 14 at the time. Swartz was also one of the
      early architects of the Creative Commons licences and a developer of
      Internet Archives’ Open Library – a free book database and digital library
      open to the public. He was an early leader in the development of Reddit, a
      giant online activist hub, as well as the co-founder of Demand Progress
      which was an effective advocacy group that led the United States Congress
      to back down from controversial anti-piracy legislation.

      Swartz was adamant that information, particularly that which may benefit
      society, be made freely available to the public. In 2011, Swartz liberated
      4.8 million articles from an archive of academic journals called JSTOR
      which was available only by paid subscription to libraries and
      institutions. Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of
      wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
      carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in
      prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release. Swartz
      committed suicide on the 11 January 2013 while awaiting his trial. Swartz
      was posthumously awarded the Madison Award for being 
      <i
        >“an outspoken advocate for public participation in government and
        unrestricted access to peer-reviewed scholarly articles.”

    <h3>The Vision of Aaron’s Kit - An Ecosystem Approach</h3>
    <p>
      A young innovative advocate, an eloquent thinker; Aaron Swartz was a gift
      to the world. Aaron not only spoke about his ideas, but he pursued them
      vigorously. Aaron fought against the unfettered power of large
      institutions and ultimately ended his fight at 26 years old. However, the
      essence of Aaron’s fight has never ceased to exist as his vision continues
      to be pursued by a growing global community. Aaron’s Kit Team understands
      that Open Access is not about competition - instead, it’s about
      coordination and driving a community corporation. The key idea of Aaron’s
      Kit is accessibility at the highest order, and here we hope to democratise
      knowledge by freely providing access to academic journals.
